# JavaWebProgramming

## Solution Project

This is the complete solution project for a dynamic web application. 

In this course we create dynamic web applications using Java Servlets, JSPs, and JSTL. This course assumes knowledge of basic Object-Oriented programming concepts and expands on basic Java knowledge.

In this course we will:

- Use Java to create dynamic web applications
- Deploy Java web applications to a local tomcat server
- Use and understand server-side Java web technologies including Servlets, JSPs, JSTL
- Design Java web applications using the MVC design pattern

New material emphasized includes Collections classes, JDBC, Servlets, and Java Server Pages.

### Learning Objectives

1. Use the Eclipse IDE to build dynamic web projects with Java
2. Explore and use the Java 8 Specification as a resource for building Java web applications
3. Implement error and exception handling for a Java web application
4. Use Java servlets as controllers for a Java web application
5. Use JSPs as views for a Java web application
6. Use the MVC design pattern to architect a Java web application
7. Integrate database technologies in a Java web application using a basic JDBC SQLite driver
